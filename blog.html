                I chose HBO-ICT because I have always been interested in how computers and the programs on them work. 
                I like to find out how the different components work together and to play around with this. 
                I have also tried to make small games with the help of Youtube tutorials.
                <br> <br>
                At the moment it is not entirely clear to me what I am going to do after my studies, 
                but it will most likely be something within software development or <abbr title="Business IT Consultant">BIC</abbr>.
                <br> <br>
                As for how I started at HZ. I have visited several schools including HZ(HBO-ICT) and Avans(Informatica / Technical Informatics) and made some online tests.
                At first I chose Avans(Informatica), but after a year I decided to start at HZ(HBO-ICT).

                Strenghts: <br>
                -perseverance (If I want something, then I try my best to achieve it) <br>
                -Focused (can work for long time on 1 task/assignment) <br>
                -Team player (besides working independently I can also work well in groups) <br> <br>

                Weaknesses: <br>
                -Too focused (too focused on 1 task, sometimes causing me to overlook other (smaller) tasks) <br>
                -Too flexible towards uncooperative group members <br> <br>

                Opportunities: <br>
                -Learning lots in the field of ICT <br> <br>

                Theats: <br>
                -demotivated by group members (If i'm grouped with unmotivated students I tend to be less motivated) <br>

                Before I started at HZ I studied for a year at Avans HBO Informatica. There, I made several projects.
                These projects involved:
                <li>A website (made with HTML, CSS, JS and Bootstrap).</li>
                <li>A Windows application written in Java with a MySQL database link.</li>
                <li>An Android application written in Java where information about movies and series was retrieved and
                  displayed using an API. (TheMovieDB).</li>
                <li>An API written in JS, This used Node.js, Npm, Mocha, Chai, MySQL and JWT.</li>
                <li>A PWA written in Vue.js, PHP, JS and HTML (This was a project for an employer. This project is
                  online and
                  can be found at https://www.1t3.nl/).</li>
                  <br>
                For many of these projects, we were taught how to work with Git.
                Besides these project I tried to make a small game in Unity using YouTube tutorials.

              <p class="card-text">
                For our first feedback moment, we had to create a website that reflected various information about the course. 
                We then had to present this website to a group of students and teachers. 
                The feedback I received on this was mainly from the teachers present. 
                The feedback I received concerned: 
                <li>The lack of a blog page</li> 
                <li>The lack of a progress bar</li>
                <li>The use of capitals in file names</li>
                I then applied this feedback to improve my site.
